* Nested properties

  :layout.size.width 300
  -> (.. obj getLayout getSize (setWidth 300))

* Styling by class

  Using class names in styles to style, say, all JButton's.

* Custom adders

* Caching Computed Styles for Objects

  It'll preserve style in a map in gui state so we could reuse it
  later. Probably needed for custom adders (we need to know *adder
  property of parent when creating children -- not possible atm).
